In this project, I used Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to merge, clean and statistically analyze the findings of a series of cancer drug trials, measuring the drug regimen, tumor volume, weight and sex of individual mice per program. 

After cleaning the data for duplicates, measurements of the mean, median, standard deviation and variance of different regimens were taken, revealing that Capomulin had the overall lowest mean and median tumor volumes, possibly indicating its effectiveness in comparison. 

The study took the most measurements on mice on the Capomulin and Ramicane regimens, and had a very slight (51% to 49%) bias toward male mice being measured. 

For the final comparisons between the Capomulin, Ceftamin, Infubinol and Ramicane regimens, box plots displayed a much lower distribution of tumor volumes of Capomulin and Ramicane at the final timepoints. Filtering for the final timepoints indicates that the end result of these regimens were the most successful.

The mouse s185, a mouse treated with Capomulin, experienced dramatic tumor volume reduction, with the tumor shrinking from 45 mm3 to under 25 by the final timepoint. 

In measuring the average volume of tumors as related to weight for mice on the Capomulin regimen, a correlation coefficient of 0.95 was found, indicating a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Without having seen the trial, I morbidly assume these tumors are large enough to be a major factor in the weight of the mouse, and that the 45 mm3 starting point for mice was perhaps heavy enough to alter their total weight.

This chart displays the relationship between tumor volume and mouse weight for the most successful drug regimen.
